---
```

### Frontmatter Field Constraints

| Field         | Required | Constraints                                                      |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | Yes      | 1-64 chars, lowercase `a-z`, numbers, hyphens. Must match dir.   |
| `description` | Yes      | 1-1024 chars. Describe what it does and when to use it.          |
| `license`     | No       | License name (default: MIT)                                      |
| `metadata`    | No       | Key-value pairs (author, version, etc.)                          |

### Name Field Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Cannot start or end with hyphen
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match parent directory name exactly

**Valid**: `page-cro`, `email-sequence`, `ab-test-setup`
**Invalid**: `Page-CRO`, `-page`, `page--cro`

### Optional Skill Directories

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # Required - main instructions (<500 lines)
├── references/     # Optional - detailed docs loaded on demand
├── scripts/        # Optional - executable code
└── assets/         # Optional - templates, data files
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Structure

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines (move details to `references/`)
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists liberally
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)

### Tone

- Direct and instructional
- Second person ("You are a conversion rate optimization expert")
- Professional but approachable

### Formatting

- Bold (`**text**`) for key terms
- Code blocks for examples and templates
- Tables for reference data
- No excessive emojis

### Clarity Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Specific over vague
- Active voice over passive
- One idea per section

### Description Field Best Practices

The `description` is critical for skill discovery. Include:
1. What the skill does
2. When to use it (trigger phrases)
3. Related skills for scope boundaries

```yaml
description: When the user wants to optimize conversions on any marketing page. Use when the user says "CRO," "conversion rate optimization," "this page isn't converting." For signup flows, see signup-flow-cro.
```

## Tool Integrations

This repository includes a tools registry for agent-compatible marketing tools.

### Registry Structure

```
tools/
├── REGISTRY.md              # Index of all tools with capabilities
└── integrations/            # Detailed integration guides
    ├── ga4.md
    ├── stripe.md
    ├── rewardful.md
    └── ...
```

### When to Use Tools

Skills reference relevant tools for implementation. For example:
- `referral-program` skill → rewardful, tolt, dub-co, mention-me guides

## Checking for Updates

When using any skill from this repository:

1. **Once per session**, on first skill use, check for updates:
   - Fetch `VERSIONS.md` from GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills/main/VERSIONS.md
   - Compare versions against local skill files

2. **Only prompt if meaningful**:
   - 2 or more skills have updates, OR
   - Any skill has a major version bump (e.g., 1.x to 2.x)

3. **Non-blocking notification** at end of response:
   ```
   ---
   Skills update available: X marketing skills have updates.
   Say "update skills" to update automatically, or run `git pull` in your marketingskills folder.
   ```

4. **If user says "update skills"**:
   - Run `git pull` in the marketingskills directory
   - Confirm what was updated

## Skill Categories
